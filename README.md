custom-tools:
	reduce_blanks.py

This plugin arranges selected lines by functions:
1. to indent (and strip space charaters at the right and the left of) each line with the same indent level as the first selected line; 

2. to delete all blank lines of the selected lines;

3. to reduce all continous blank lines selected into only one.

4. to sort lines in alphabetical order, if the list is already sorted the order will be reversed (like 'Line Sorter' plugin);
